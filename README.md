## Getting started

The homepage has a button that will take you to the page that randomly generates a metal band name, with a random album cover. On this page there is a link for a page with a random album, showing the label, album name, and tracklist. Also on the homepage is a link to a page that shows several different album covers. If a specific album cover is clicked, a new page will display that album cover larger.
Each page also has a link to return to the homepage.
